# Potential headline:
Who is Kevin Murtha?

## Initial goal
To analyse city's payroll database and see if there are a set of factors that explain who gets the most overtime among city employees.

## Data source
[Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/data) from 2019, 2020 and 2021

## Analyses
Check [this notebook](https://github.com/code4journalism/regressions-pre-pitch-areenaarora/blob/main/pitch-update.ipynb) for the analyses

## Initial findings
*Assumption* 
* We approached the dataset with the assumption that overtime pay should only be dependent on number of overtime hours worked. In regression terms, we assumed, the adjusted R squared for overtime earned and number of overtime hours worked will be 1, meaning the two explain 100% variation in each other. 

*Findings*
* One outlier making a ton more in overtime pay compared to others.

## Reporting questions
1. How to find deductions to calculate net, or take-home pay?
2. Why did he leave NYPD in 2021?


## What to do next?
1. Look at payroll data for all city cops from 2014 onwards (? earliest available?)
2. Interview requests -- how to reach Kevin?

### Min story:
1. Data found this anamoly. NYPD couldn't be reached for comments. 
2. Apply the same metric to payroll data for other city departments (or just FD?) to find other outliers

### Max story:
1. Solve the mystery of Kevin Murtha and win a Pulitzer :)
